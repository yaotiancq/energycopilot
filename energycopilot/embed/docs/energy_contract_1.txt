Section 7: Indemnification
7.1 To the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement, each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, and its current and future direct and indirect parent companies, affiliates and their shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, servants and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) and at the Indemnified Party's option, the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party from and against any and all claims and/or liabilities for losses, expenses, damage to property, injury to or death of any person, including, but not limited to, the Indemnified Party’s employees and its affiliates’ employees, subcontractors and subcontractors’ employees, or any other liability incurred by the Indemnified Party, including reasonable expenses, legal and otherwise, which shall include reasonable attorneys’ fees, caused wholly or in part by any negligent, grossly negligent or willful act or omission by the Indemnifying Party, its officers, directors, employees, agents or assigns arising out of this Agreement, except to the extent caused wholly or in part by any negligent, grossly negligent or willful act or omission of the Indemnified Party.

7.2 If any claim covered by Section 7.1 is brought against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in, and unless in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party a conflict of interest between the Parties may exist with respect to such claim, assume the defense of such claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Indemnified Party, or if a conflict precludes the Indemnifying Party from assuming the defense, then the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party on a monthly basis for the Indemnified Party’s defense through separate counsel of the Indemnified Party's choice.
Even if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Indemnified Party with acceptable counsel, the Indemnified Party, at its sole option, may participate in the defense, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choice without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations hereunder.
In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party for any indirect, special, consequential, or punitive damages of any kind whatsoever, whether in contract, tort or strict liability.

7.3 The Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify under this Section 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement, and shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for the Indemnifying Party under any statutory scheme, including, without limitation, under any Worker’s Compensation Acts, Disability Benefit Acts or other Employee Benefit Acts.

When duly assigned in accordance with the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the assignee and the assignor shall be relieved of its rights and obligations. Any assignment in violation of this Section 8 shall be void.

Section 16: Applicable Law and Venue
This Agreement shall be interpreted, governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, and shall exclude any choice of law rules that direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, irrespective of the place of execution or of the order in which the signatures of the Parties are affixed or of the place or places of performance.

Section 17: Force Majeure
Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in the performance of any part of this Agreement (other than obligations to pay money) due to any event of force majeure or other cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, unusually severe weather, flood, fire, lightning, epidemic, quarantine restriction, war, sabotage, act of a public enemy, earthquake, insurrection, riot, civil disturbance, strike, work stoppage caused by jurisdictional and similar disputes, restraint by court order or public authority, or action or non-action by or inability to obtain authorization or approval from any governmental authority, or any combination of these causes, which by the exercise of due diligence and foresight such Party could not reasonably have been expected to avoid and which by the exercise of due diligence is unable to overcome.

It is agreed that upon the Party so affected giving written notice and reasonably full particulars of such force majeure to the other Party within a reasonable time after the cause relied on, then the obligations of the Party, so far as they are affected by the event of force majeure, shall be suspended during the continuation of such inability and circumstance and shall, so far as possible, be remedied with all reasonable dispatch.

In the event of force majeure, as described herein, both Parties shall take all reasonable steps to comply with this Agreement and PG&E’s applicable tariffs despite occurrence of a force majeure event.

Such information is to remain confidential, and shall not be disclosed to any unauthorized person.

18.2 PG&E shall notify the ESP immediately and the ESP shall notify PG&E immediately of any suspected unauthorized energy use. The Parties agree to preserve any evidence of unauthorized energy use.

Unless specifically stated in this Agreement to be otherwise, the duties, obligations, and liabilities of the Parties are intended to be several and not joint or collective. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall ever be construed to create an association, trust, partnership or joint venture or to impose a trust or partnership duty, obligation, or liability on or with regard to either Party. Each Party shall be liable individually and severally for its own obligations under this Agreement.

Section 20: Conflicts Between this Agreement and PG&E’s Direct Access Tariff
Should a conflict exist or develop between the provisions of this Agreement and PG&E’s direct access tariff, as approved by the CPUC, the provisions of PG&E’s direct access tariff shall prevail.

21.2 This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and the Parties may amend the Agreement to conform to changes directed or necessitated by the CPUC. In the event the Parties are unable to agree on the required changes or modifications to this Agreement, their dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 hereof or, in the alternative, ESP may elect to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to PG&E, which shall be effective upon the receipt thereof.

If ESP is selecting this billing option:

If ESP specifies in any Direct Access Service Request any metering option that has not been checked above, the DASR will be rejected.

Section 24: Audits
24.1 PG&E and the ESP shall each retain such specific records as may be required to support the accuracy of meter data provided in their respective consolidated billings.
When either Party reasonably believes that errors related to metering or billing activity may have occurred, a Party may request the production of such documents as may be required to verify the accuracy of such metering and consolidated billing.
Such documents shall be provided within ten (10) business days of such request.
In the event the requesting Party, upon review of such documents, continues to believe that the other Party’s duty to accurately meter and provide consolidated billing for usage has been breached, the requesting Party may direct that an audit be conducted.
PG&E and the ESP shall designate their own employee representative or their contracted representative to audit the other party’s records.

24.2 Any such audit shall be undertaken at reasonable times without interference with the audited Party's business operations and in compliance with the audited Party's security procedures. PG&E and the ESP agree to cooperate fully with any such audit.

24.3 Specific records to support the accuracy of meter data provided in the consolidated billings may require examination of billing and metering support documentation maintained by subcontractors. PG&E and the ESP shall include a similar clause in their agreements with their subcontractors reserving the right to designate their own employee representative, or their contracted representative to audit records related to consolidated billing to Direct Access Customers.

24.4 The auditing Party will notify the audited Party in writing of any exception taken as a result of an audit.
The audited Party shall refund the amount of any undisputed exception to the auditing Party within ten (10) days.
If the audited Party fails to make such payment, the audited Party agrees to pay interest, accruing monthly, at a rate equal to the prime rate plus two percent (2%) of Bank of America NT&SA, San Francisco, or any successor institution, in effect from time to time, but not to exceed the maximum contract rate permitted by the applicable usury laws of the State of California.
Interest will be computed from the date of written notification of exceptions to the date the audited Party reimburses the auditing Party for any exception.
The cost of such audit shall be paid by the auditing Party; provided, however, that in the event an audit verifies overcharges of five percent (5%) or more, then the audited Party shall reimburse the auditing Party for the cost of the audit.

24.5 This right to audit shall extend for a period of three (3) years following the date of final payment under this Agreement. Each party and each subcontractor shall retain all necessary records and documentation for the entire length of this audit period.

(b) a reference to a section includes that section and all its subsections; and

(c) the words “include,” “includes,” and “including” when used in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
The Parties agree that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement.

25.2 The provisions of this Agreement are for the benefit of the Parties and not for any other person or third party beneficiary.
The provisions of this Agreement shall not impart rights enforceable by any person, firm or organization other than a Party or a successor or assignee of a Party to this Agreement.

25.3 The descriptive headings of the various sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way define, modify or restrict any of the terms and provisions thereof.

25.4 Any waiver at any time by either Party of its rights with respect to a default under this Agreement, or with respect to any other matter arising in connection with this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other or subsequent default or matter and no waiver shall be considered effective unless in writing.

25.5 Each Party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with this Agreement, except as provided in Sections 6 and 7 hereof.
If a dispute exists hereunder, the prevailing Party, as determined by the CPUC, or as may otherwise be determined by the dispute resolution procedure contained in Section 15 hereof, if used, or by a court of law, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

25.6 To the extent that the CPUC has a right under then-current law to audit either Party’s compliance with this Agreement or other legal or regulatory requirements pertaining to Direct Access transactions that Party shall cooperate with such audits.
Nothing in this Section shall be construed as an admission by either Party with respect to the right of the CPUC to conduct such audits or the scope thereof.

25.7 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all rights of termination, cancellation or other remedies in this Agreement are cumulative. Use of any remedy shall not preclude any other remedy in this Agreement.
